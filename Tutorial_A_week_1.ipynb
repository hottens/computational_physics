The file in front of your is a 'Jupyter Notebook', which is an environment that combines live coding with text. During the course, we will supply the tutorials using these notebooks. The first week of the course does not come with formal lectures, but instead consists of three tutorials, aimed at making you familiar with the Python programming language. These tutorials are by no means meant as a complete introduction to Python: rather they should be seen as a brief introduction/reference that enables a further self-study where necessary. These first three tutorials are compiled using examples from freely available Python tutorials, which we link to at the end of this document.\n","\n","You can choose to run these notebooks using the Jupyter Notebook software itself, run them in the cloud via Google Colaboratory, use a development environment like Spyder, or write local Python scripts and run them from the command line/via an interpeter. \n","\n","### Aims of this tutorial\n","To get familiar with:\n","- Basic python syntax, assigning data types\n","- The programming environment, managing packages\n","- Logical flow (i.e. loops) in Python\n","- Defining functions\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AhOCyGrwv_PT","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Part I: Working with variables and data types\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Bk_2yqcz83Hv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Getting to know the data types\n","\n","Python contains a number of different data types.
