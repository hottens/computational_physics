        "PEP8 is a formatting guideline written in the early 2000's. Sticking to it helps to keep your python code legible (a code is read more often than it is written!). You can find a condensed version below, adapted from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#intermezzo-coding-style .\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.** 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out. \n",
        "- **Wrap lines so that they donâ€™t exceed 79 characters.** This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays. If you work on notebooks in Google Colaboratory, then you'll find a line indicating 80 characters\n",
        "- **Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.**\n",
        "- **When possible, put comments on a line of their own.**\n",
        "- **Use docstrings (text between three double quotes) to explain functions**\n",
        "- **Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs**: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.\n",
        "- **Name your classes, functions and variables consistently; a suggested convention is to use UpperCamelCase for classes and lowercase_with_underscores for functions and methods.** Always use `self` as the name for the first method argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Note:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Although not per se mentioned in PEP8, it goes without saying that a clear and descriptive variable name will make your life easier in any case. \n",
        "- Note that there are no set-in-stone conventions. Most importantly, you should try to use any type of convention for naming variables etc. **consistently**. \n",

        "### List comprehensions and generator expressions\n",
        "You can make your code more legible (and less error-prone) by manipulting lists in efficient ways. In tutorial 1 you assigned list elements. In tutorial 3, you will work with some of the built-in functions for python lists. Here, you will learn about list comprehensions and generator expressions, which will help you to write efficient and clear code.\n",
        "##### List comprehension\n",
        "A very powerful feature in Python is list comprehension. It allows you to create lists in a very concise, compact manner, bypassing the need for writing loops to element-wise fill up the list. A very simple example is:\n",
        " ```\n",

        "```\n",
        "**Insert this command in the code-cell below and print the result**. This will create a list containing the squares of the numbers 1 to 5. There is no need to construct multiple lines of code including a for loop to create the list. It is almost readable English, isn't it?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many more possibilities and you can make it as complicated as you want. Try to use list comprehensions for defining the following lists:\n",
        "- Print the list `odd` that contains all even numbers between 0 and 20 (you can use an `if` and a modulo (`%`) statement)\n",
        "- Print the list `pos` of all numbers in a number range (-10,10), but only print the positive version (that is, multiply all the negative numbers with -1)\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Generators\n",
        "A related concept is the concept of generators. You can apply generators by using round brackets instead of square brackets in the example of the squares of 1-5 shown above. It will not generate the actual values, but only create a recipe to generate them when needed. An example is the `range` function we encountered before. This can save you lots of memory usage. Try the following:\n",
        "\n",

        "- Build a generator using the same expression (give it a different name)\n",
        "- Print the both the generator and the output of the list comprehension, and their `types`\n",
        "- Loop over the contents of the generator and the output of the comprehension, and print each element. Once finished, print the contents of the generator (see hint below). What do you see? Can you explain this?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note** A generator can be converted to a lists or tuples by using `list(generator)` or `tuple(generator)` respectively."

        "\n",
        "Functions are reusable pieces of code that increase readability and modularity of your programs. They execute certain statements, possibly based on input arguments. At this point in the tutorials, you have already used many different built-in functions (take the `print()` function, for example). It is also possible to define your own functions using the `def` statement. For example\n",

        "```\n",
        "which can be called by writing `sayHello()`. It will then print 'Hello there!' to the screen. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Functions with input and output\n",
        "You can write functions that have input arguments and/or return some value\n",
        "```\n",
        "def power(number, power):\n",
        "    return number**power\n",
        "```\n",
        "The function now requires one input argument, it is called by `y=power(x,p)` which will assign the value of `x**p` to the variable `y`.  You will get an error if no argument is given. To prevent this, it is also possible to give a default value or *keyword argument*, which value will then be taken when no input argument is specified:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def power(number=1, power=0):\n",
        "    return number**power\n",

        "\n",
        "***Note:*** It is possible to make combinations, where part of the input arguments have default values, e.g. defining `power(number, power=0)`. However, be careful to define `power(number=1, power)` may give problems (you may try this).\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Flexible input arguments\n",
        "Flexible arguments can be used if the number of input arguments is not necessarily fixed. Indicating a * before a variable name gives variable-length single-value input (similar to MATLAB's varargin), ** gives variable-length keyword-value pairs inputs. Both can be empty. Applications include functions where additional settings can be specified, in no particular order. The example below illustrates how the function treats the input arguments.\n",
        "```\n",
        "def print_arguments(*args, **kwargs):\n",
        "    for a in args:\n",
        "        print(a)\n",

        "        print(a, kwargs[a])\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercises\n",
        "1. Define and execute the functions `sayHello`, `power` and `print_arguments` above. Play with the inputs to learn how it works.\n",
        "2. Why would it be bad to define a function like `power(number=1, power)`?\n",
        "3. Define the list `list=[10, 2]` and the dictionairy `dict={'number': 10, 'power': 2}` and call the `power` functions above with `power(*list)` or `power(**dict)`. Note that lists (or tuples for that matter) require a single asterisk, and dictionairies require a double asterisk.\n",
        "4. Write a function that takes as input a number, and returns true or false depending on whether the number is 'perfect'. This means that all of the number's positive divisors summed together should form the original number itself. For example: 6 is a perfect number, since it is divisable by 1 2 and 3, and since 1+2+3=6.\n",
        "5. Apply your function by building a list that contains all numbers that are 'perfect' between 0 and 100000. You can also use a list comprehension\n",

        "One of the most puzzling and frustrating aspects of programming is debugging. Below we provide some tips for debugging your code, which might come in handy throughout this course.\n",

        "#### Debugging tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### General advice:\n",
        "- **Try to think of your code structure before writing (i.e. write pseudocode first!)**. See the above section on pseudocode.\n",
        "- **Build in simple checks while working on your code, and remove them afterwards**. Example: Let's say your code operates on an array of a certain size, or calculates a quantity that has a known property (for example, always larger than a certainva lue). Build in simple if-statements that print an error message (or stop the code) when the array size changes, or the value of the quantity reaches a forbidden value. This helps you to track down problems in an earlier stage (don't forget to remove the checks afterwards!)\n",
        "- **Use logging while developing your code.** Have your code print things like indices, lists/their elements, data types, memory locations (in case you copy variables into different variables) which part of the code it is currently executing, etc. You can always remove the statements afterwards. This helps you confirm that the code is indeed operating according to plan. Alternatively, you can print these statements to a file, or use a dedicated logging module.\n",
        "- **Change one thing at a time**. Generally, don't run the code only after writing large chunks. Where possible, try to run the code as often as possible to track bugs earlier on.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### When encountering a Python error message:\n",
        "- **Use the internet (yes really)**. A perk of Python is that its error messages are recognizable. You can often paste your error message into Google, and search on dedicated programming-help websites like StackOverflow for where your error comes from, and how to solve it.\n",
        "- **Print the data types and output of the involved variables**. Oftentimes, you are trying an operation on a data type that doesn't allow said operation, or you are trying to reconcile objects with different dimensions. `print(type())` and `print(size())` are your friends.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### When your code does not do what it should do, but you don't know why\n",
        "\n",
        "- **First of all: try to reproduce the problem**. A large part in finding where the erroneous behavior comes from consists of finding the circumstances during which the behavior occurs. Look critically at your input, and try to print variables and output while you are waiting for your bug to occur.\n",
        "- **Try to come up with a good test case:** Is there any expected output when you provide a specific input?\n",
        "- **Execute the smallest possible part of the code that leads to reproduction of your bug**. Once you have found an input that consistently leads to a bug and have a reference output,  try to narrow down on the part of the code where the erroneous output comes from. This process is iterative in the sense that it might in the end lead you down into different functions etc.\n",
        "- **Tackling the specific bug:** At this point, there are many, many things that might have gone wrong. Use a combination of logging, checks and visualizations (i.e. printing or plotting) to determine what your exact problem is. An option that we will not discuss here, but which is available (and used) is the python debugger. For instructions on how to use the python debugger, see for example \n",

If you got to this point of the tutorial and still have plenty of time left, consider applying these skills to some of the problems on https://projecteuler.net/archives . These problems are mathematical in nature, and can be solved by writing a simple piece of python code, where you will need many of the concepts that you have learned during this and the previous tutorial.\n"
