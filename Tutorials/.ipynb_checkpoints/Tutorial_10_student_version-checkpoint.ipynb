The string has a constant density $\\rho$ per unit length, a constant tension $T$, no frictional forces acting on it, and a tension that is so high that we may ignore sagging as a result of gravity. We assume that the displacement of the string from its rest position $y(x, t)$ is in the vertical direction only and that it is a function of the horizontal location along the string $x$ and the time $t$.\n",

    "1. Initialize a function that returns the `101`by`time_steps`-sized array that contains the solution to the wave equation in time. The function should take the amount of space grid points, $\\rho$, $T$, number of time steps, etc. as inputs (it is handy to use defaults). Within your function, initialize `np.empty` or `np.zeros` arrays of the right size. You will later on define the initial conditions by setting the first row of the solution array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We used the central-difference approximation to discretize the wave equation into a difference equation (see below). This form permits us to predict the future solution from the present and past solutions. Complete your function by adding the following FD algorithm for updating the solution. Over which values do you iterate? Explain why you cannot use this expression for the first time step, and decide how you will implement the boundary conditions (i.e. fixed endpoints). Make sure that you carefully consider the meaning of `i` and `j` in your code.\n",

Nonetheless, the rest condition ( $\\frac{\\partial y(x,0)}{\\partial t}=0$) when combined with the central-difference approximation lets us extrapolate to negative time to obtain the following expression for the $\\textbf{first step}$ (equation 21.23 of the book). Add this expression to your code as well.\n",

For each case examine the vibration mode and decide whether you have a standing wave or a travelling wave (observe whether the pulses move or just oscillate up and down).
