        "In this tutorial you will solve a second-order partial differential equation to find the electrical potential between two parallel plates using FEM. FEM is a powerful technique in which a geometry for which you want to solve a differential equation is divided in small elements (hence the name). The differential equations that describe the physical process for the small elements are then assembled to a larger system of equations, which is then solved iteratively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although finite-difference methods are simpler to implement than FEM, they are less robust mathematically and for big problems less efficient in terms of computer time. Finite element methods, in turn, are more complicated to implement, but more appropriate and precise for more complicated equations and geometries. In addition, the same basic finite-element techniques can be applied to many problems with only minor modifications, and yield solutions that may be evaluated throughout all space, not just on a grid. In fact, the FEM has very much become the standard for large-scale engineering applications.\n",

        "### Finding K and F\n",
        "As discussed in the previous section, solving this differential equation can be reduced to solving a system of linear equations (see equation 11). For this problem $[K]$ and $\\{F\\}$ (see equation 12 and 13) can be written as: $$K_{ij}=\\int_\\Omega \\Big(\\frac{d\\phi_{i}}{dx}\\frac{d\\phi_{j}}{dx}\\Big)$$ $$F_{i}=\\int_\\Omega \\phi_{i}4\\pi\\rho(x)dx$$ Using the equation of shape functions (see equation 8), and assuming that all the elements have equal sizes of $h_{i}=h$, $[K]$ can be calculated with simple integrations (see equations 23.17-23.19 of the book). The $[K]$ matrix is then obtained as follows (for N=5 for example): \n",
