        "Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a workhorse of modern computational science. Not only did the field move beyond simple systems like gases or liquids, MD simulations are currently used at the atomic scale to study many (bio)physical/chemical processes. As seen in the lectures, MD simulations allow us to study the dynamcis and equilibrium properties of systems of particles, where we make use of classical physics. \n",

        "    6. How do you calculate the time-evolution of a moving particle using the Verlet algorithm? When is the Verlet algorithm not accurate anymore?\n",

In the tutorial, you are asked to implement the functions for the Verlet algorithm (integrating the equations of motion) and the general program structure yourself. Animations, force functions and initialization are done by us.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Set the relevant system parameters (think: temperature, number of particles, type of particles, density, timestep). The system is initialized using a dedicated function (see Pseudocode 2). This leads to the particles having a starting position and velocity within the simulation box. \n",
        "2. The forces on all the particles (Pseudocode 3) in the systems are determined using a force function (typically a Lennard Jones-potential). This function can also calculate the potential energy.\n",
        "3. The velocities and positions are updated by integrating Newton's equations of motion (Pseudocode 4) using the Verlet algorithm.\n",
        "4. This process repeats itself while iterating over time, where we save variables of interest (density, pressure, temperature, current coordinates and velocities or other physical quantities) every so many steps.\n",

        "2. In order to form a simulation system at the right temperature that at the same time doesn't drift, you calculate the center-of-mass velocity of the system (the sum over all velocity vectors of all the particles) and the sum of the squared velocity vectors. \n",

You can even call the `initialize` and `force` functions once. \n",

        "2. Apply the velocity verlet algorithm to update the positions.\n",
        "3. You need to check whether the position update does not lead to particles moving outside of the box. You can make a loop over the dimensions (there are three), and check for which elements in the `positions` array the particle has moved outside of the box (i.e. any coordinate is below 0 or larger than `box_size`). You can use `np.where(position[:,dimension] > box_sizeor )` for example.\n",

        "5. With the updated forces in place, update the velocities using the final call of the Velocity Verlet algorithm.\n",
